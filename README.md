# NY_Accidents_Project
This is an end to end project that analyzes NYC Collision Data. It involves ETL with Snowflake and AWS, Data Cleaning with Python, Dimension Modeling and KPIs using SQL and visualization using Tableau.

This readme outlines findings from in-depth analyses of police-reported motor vehicle crashes within New York City, focusing on efforts to support the cityâ€™s goal of improving public safety by reducing injuries and fatalities emanating from traffic crashes. Using detailed crash data from the Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, we collaborated in a city-dedicated decoding project to analyze the patterns, causes, and consequences of road incidents within this city.

The project involved a rigorous data analysis approach, employing dimension modeling, entity relationship diagramming, and a comprehensive data transformation process. Data dictionaries were meticulously built, and a robust dimensional model was designed using a STAR schema. The data then underwent intricate transformations to maintain integrity and usability. The analysis primarily focused on key performance areas (KPAs) such as crashes by location, injuries, fatalities by contributing factors, and involvement with other modes of transportation.

Our results reveal substantial spatial and temporal patterns in collision occurrences, which could inform targeted interventions in specific boroughs and critical areas. The key finding highlights driver inattention/distraction and unsafe speed as the predominant contributing factors for both injuries and fatalities. Moreover, the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens exhibit a higher rate of these incidents, necessitating a focused approach to safety measures in these areas.

Based on our analysis, we recommend a multidimensional approach toward road safety, encompassing data-driven enforcement, infrastructural development, public awareness campaigns, policy initiatives, and the adoption of technology to assist in traffic management and accident prevention.
